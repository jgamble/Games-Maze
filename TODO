THINGS TO COME

There was a long list here in version 1.02.  It's gone here because I
intend to re-write Games::Maze this year.

The main feature that will appear in the version 2.00-track will be
plug-ins for making the maze (I already have three different ones written).

Output will be changed, and might be done with plug-ins as well.

I will keep the version 1.00-track Games::Maze on CPAN because there are
some scripts and modules that use it, but any changes to it will be
maintenance only.  Any new features will be put in the version 2.00-track.

If you have any suggestions, or want to critique the work so far, please
contact me at the e-mail address in the module.
