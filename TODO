THINGS TO COME

In rough order of personal priorities:

0   Change the internal array to a bit vector.  Right now the $m[][][]
    style is a legacy from old Fortran code.

1   Make some compile-time options run-time options instead.  Examples
    would be: step-by-step making and solving; other debugging options.

2   Multiply-connected mazes.  Currently the mazes created are
    singly-connected.

3   Choosing maze generation styles, e.g., 'symetric-2', 'symetric-4', etc.

4   Postscript output.

5   GIF output.

6   Other tiles for mazes (octagon/square, for example)

7   Interactive view of the maze from the point of view of the pathwalker.

8   Four-dimensional mazes.  Certainly possible to do, complicated
    only by the layout of the printing.

9   Complicated 3-D tessellation, as opposed to the 3-D mazes that we have
    now that are merely layered 2-D tessellations.  For example, an
    octohedron/tetrahedron space filling, as seen in M. C. Escher's
    I<Curl-Up>, or the hexagon/pentagon tiling on the surface of a soccer
    ball.  Don't expect these anytime before an interactive view gets made.
