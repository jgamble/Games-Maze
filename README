INSTALLATION

The usual way.  Unpack the archive:
	gzip -d Games-Maze-1.08.tar.gz
	tar xvf  Games-Maze-1.08.tar

This package now uses Module::Build, and the Build.PL script
but you can still use Makefile.PL, which is provided.

Go to the resulting directory, and type:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make 

Run the tests:
	make test 

Install the module:
	make install

Alternatively, you can use Build.PL:
	perl Build.PL
	Build

Run the tests:
